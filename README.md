# Maze Game: Dynamic Path Planner

This project is a Maze Game where you can choose between two maze sizes: Mini and Mega. The goal is to navigate from a start point to an endpoint using dynamic programming, with the path calculated and visualized.

### Features:
- **Mini and Mega options**: Choose your maze size via the terminal.
- **Dynamic Programming Pathfinding**: Solves the maze using dynamic programming.
- **Interactive Start Point Selection**: Click on the start point to begin your pathfinding journey.

### How it Works:
1. **Choosing the Maze Size**: You can select between two maze sizes: Mini or Mega.
2. **Selecting the Start Point**: Once the maze is loaded, you can select the start point interactively.
3. **Pathfinding with Dynamic Programming**: The program solves the maze from the start point to the endpoint using dynamic programming.
